    <p className='BioText'>
    Hi! I am a New York City based growing software developer. I was born and raised in Harlem, NYC. In 2012 I graduated from one of NYC's specialized High schools Brookyn Technical HS.
    Later in 2016, I graduated Widener University with Bachelors of Arts in Psychology. Upon my graduation, I wanted to work in the field of Human Resources. After a few experiences in the field I quickly changed my mind.
    Fall of 2016 is when I learned about coding bootcamps and through their rigorous program one can change there career to become a software developer. I was immediately interested in this because I knew I liked working
    with computers and I knew I wanted to learn programming. Aside from that, I also had some ideas for some application that were not out that I could possibly create. Fully motivated, I started to teach myself the basics of
    Ruby, JavaScript, and basic computer science concepts from online resources. After about 7 months of part time working and studying object oriented programming, I applied to Flatiron's immersive fullstack web development program.
    Here I learned technologies such as Ruby on Rails, more advanced JavaScript, and React.js. I graduated from Flatiron School in January of 2018 and now I spend my time working on personal projects and looking to start my professional
    career as a React/JavaScript/Fullstack developer.
